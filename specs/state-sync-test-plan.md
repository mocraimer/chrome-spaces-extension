## Test Coverage

### Implemented Tests
- State update broadcasting core functionality
- Storage operation atomicity
- Basic error handling and recovery
- Window operation state consistency
- Concurrent update handling

### Planned Additional Coverage
1. Network condition handling
   - Slow network conditions
   - Network disconnection/reconnection
   - Partial update delivery

2. Edge Cases
   - Maximum number of windows
   - Very large state objects
   - Rapid window creation/destruction

3. Performance Testing
   - State update latency
   - Storage operation timing
   - Memory usage under load

## Test Execution Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Run as part of CI/CD pipeline
   - Must pass before any deployment
   - Coverage threshold: 90%

2. Integration Tests
   - Run on staging environment
   - Test real Chrome window interactions
   - Focus on cross-component functionality

3. Performance Tests
   - Run weekly on production-like environment
   - Monitor latency and resource usage
   - Set baseline performance metrics

## Success Criteria

1. Functional Requirements
   - All unit tests pass
   - Integration tests show consistent state across windows
   - Error recovery mechanisms work as expected

2. Performance Requirements
   - State updates propagate within 100ms
   - Storage operations complete within 200ms
   - Memory usage stays within acceptable limits

3. Reliability Requirements
   - System recovers from all error conditions
   - No data loss during crash recovery
   - Consistent state maintained across all scenarios
