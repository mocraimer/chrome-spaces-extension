# Chrome Spaces Extension Performance Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the Chrome Spaces Extension. The performance test suite is designed to measure and validate the extension's performance against specified thresholds, ensuring a smooth user experience even under heavy load conditions.

## Test Environment

### Configuration

- **Isolated Test Environment**: Tests run in a Node.js environment with mocked Chrome APIs
- **Consistent Conditions**: Fixed hardware simulation and controlled test parameters
- **Performance Monitoring**: High-precision timing using the Performance API
- **Scale Factor Variations**: Tests run with varying load factors (1, 10, 100 tabs)

### Setup

- Performance tests use dedicated mock services that simulate realistic timing
- Chrome APIs are mocked to provide consistent behavior
- Tests run with increased timeout values to accommodate performance measurements
- Performance metrics are collected and reported in a structured format

## Performance Test Cases

### 1. Window Creation Performance

#### Test Case: PC-001
- **Title**: Window Creation with Single Tab
- **Description**: Measure the time taken to create a window with a single tab
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Mock services initialized
  - Performance monitoring active
- **Steps**:
  - Create a window with a single URL
  - Measure execution time
- **Expected Result**: Window creation completes within 200ms
- **Priority**: High

#### Test Case: PC-002
- **Title**: Window Creation with 10 Tabs
- **Description**: Measure the time taken to create a window with 10 tabs
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Mock services initialized
  - Performance monitoring active
- **Steps**:
  - Create a window with 10 URLs
  - Measure execution time
- **Expected Result**: Window creation completes within 200ms
- **Priority**: High

#### Test Case: PC-003
- **Title**: Window Creation with 100 Tabs
- **Description**: Measure the time taken to create a window with 100 tabs
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Mock services initialized
  - Performance monitoring active
- **Steps**:
  - Create a window with 100 URLs
  - Measure execution time
- **Expected Result**: Window creation completes within 500ms
- **Priority**: Medium

### 2. State Synchronization Performance

#### Test Case: PS-001
- **Title**: State Synchronization Between Windows
- **Description**: Measure the latency of state synchronization between multiple windows
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Multiple windows created
  - Mock services initialized
- **Steps**:
  - Update state in one window
  - Measure time until state is synchronized to other windows
- **Expected Result**: State synchronization completes within 100ms
- **Priority**: High

### 3. Popup Interaction Performance

#### Test Case: PP-001
- **Title**: Popup Responsiveness During Heavy State Updates
- **Description**: Measure popup interaction responsiveness during heavy state updates
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Multiple spaces created
  - Mock services initialized
- **Steps**:
  - Trigger multiple rapid state updates
  - Measure popup rendering time during updates
- **Expected Result**: Popup interactions remain responsive (< 16ms) during state updates
- **Priority**: Critical

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Thresholds

| Operation | Condition | Threshold | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Window Creation | ≤ 10 tabs | < 200ms | High |
| Window Creation | > 10 tabs | < 500ms | Medium |
| State Synchronization | Between windows | < 100ms | High |
| Popup Interaction | During state updates | < 16ms | Critical |

### Test Environment Requirements

- Tests must run in isolated environments
- Performance metrics must be collected with high precision
- Tests must be repeatable with consistent results
- Scale factor variations must be tested (1, 10, 100 tabs)

## Reporting

Performance test results are reported in a structured format:

```
Performance Test Report:

```

## Implementation Details

### Performance Monitoring

Performance metrics are collected using the `PerformanceMonitor` class, which:
- Measures execution time of operations
- Compares against defined thresholds
- Generates detailed reports

### Test Utilities

- `performanceUtils.ts`: Utilities for measuring and reporting performance
- `mockServices.ts`: Mock services that simulate realistic timing
- `setup.ts`: Test environment configuration

### Running Performance Tests

Performance tests can be run using the following command:

```
npm run test:performance
```

This uses a dedicated Jest configuration (`jest.performance.config.ts`) that sets up the appropriate test environment and reporting.

## Continuous Integration

Performance tests should be integrated into the CI pipeline to:
- Track performance trends over time
- Detect performance regressions
- Ensure performance thresholds are maintained

Performance test results should be archived and compared across builds to identify trends.
